{"name":"Switcherblur","tagline":"Configurable iOS 7 switcher snapshots blur.","body":"Using a simple, low-level gaussian blur, SwitcherBlur allows for configurable switcher snapshot (\"previews\") blurring. By default, SwitcherBlur will blur *every* app preview in the iOS 7 switcher, however, by adding apps to the Settings' Blacklist area, it's possible to prevent specific apps from being affected. In addition, enabling \"Inactive Blur\" will only blur apps that aren't currently running in the background (unless Blacklisted), making the switcher ultimately far more useful and attractive.\r\n\r\n![1.2 Switcher/Settings](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/951011/2164692/310bcc10-94ef-11e3-9808-f1479f93117b.PNG)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
